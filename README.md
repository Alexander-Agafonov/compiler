# JACK Compiler

This is a Jack to virtual machine code compiler that I implemented in C. Jack is an object-oriented programming language, somewhat similar to Java.
The compiler itself consists of the following 4 components: lexer, parser, symbol table and virtual machine code generator. 

## Lexer
The first step is to turn the source code into a stream of tokens. A token is simply a structure that contains information about one lexeme - a lexeme may be a reserved keyword, an identifier, or a syntactic element, such as a bracket. A lexical error is thrown if the source code contains things like illegal symbols (e.g. Â£ not enclosed in apostrophes) or, for example, if an identifier starts with a digit (e.g. 2_happy). If the lexer detects no errors in the token stream, we proceed to the next stage.

## Parser
The parser is probably the most significant component of the compiler. Parser has access to a number of functions that pretty much define the syntax of Jack. When the parser receives a token, it first checks the token type and then identifies which other tokens are allowed to come after. For example, the parser may receive a token containg a reserved keyword "class" when a user wants to define a new class in Jack. According to the Jack syntax, the next token must then contain an identifier. If the expected token type does not match, the parser issues a syntactic error. Naturally, there are cases when multiple different types of tokens may follow. The only requirement is that the rules of the Jack grammar are obeyed - assuming, of course, that the source is free of lexical errors. The full Jack grammar can be found
